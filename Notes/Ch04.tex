\section{Fixed-Type Arrays in Python}
Python offers several different options for storing data in efficient, fixed-type data buffers. The built-in array module (available since Python 3.3) can be used to create dense arrays of a uniform type.

While Python's array object provides efficient storage of array-based data, NumPy adds to this efficient operations on that data.
\section{Creating Arrays from Python Lists}

Remember that unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays can only contain data of the same type. If the types do not match, NumPy will upcast them according to its type promotion rules.
